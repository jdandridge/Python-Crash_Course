think of at least threee kinds of your favorite pizza. store these pizza names in 
a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.

--> modify your for loop to print a sentance using the name of the pizza inseatd 
of printing just the name of the pizza. for each pizza you should have one line 
of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.

--> add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how 
muchy you like pizza. the ouput should consit fo three or more lines about the 
kinds fo pizza you like and then an additional sentancer, such as i really love 
pizza!
